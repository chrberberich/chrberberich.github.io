**Unemployment and job vacancies**

The economist Maurice Höfgen often points out that there are more unemployed people than jobs that can be filled immediately. I took this as an opportunity to investigate the relationship between vacancies and the number of unemployed. For the analysis, I matched the official unemployment statistics from Bundesargentur für Arbeit with a data set from the Institut für Arbeitsmarkt- und Berufsforschung (IAB). The linear regression model explains 51% (see R-squared) of the variance of the absolute number of unemployed with job vacancies as the independent variable. Such strong evidenz are rarely found in the social sciences. It also shows that the neoclassical labor market model does not work, because unemployment is strongly negatively correlated with vacancies at the macro level (see correlation coefficient). The dashboard shows the correlation coefficient, the R-squared, a plot of the trend data and a plot of the regression model.

# Global GDP Comparison

## Über dieses Projekt {.sidebar position="left" width="30%"}

**Über dieses Projekt**

This little project has the background to demonstrate my advanced data visualization skills. The world map shows the GDP in 2023 as a headmap based on a data set from the World Bank. The challenge was not only of a technical nature. Due to the fact that the USA and China are extremely strong compared to all other countries, it is not easy to show this as a heat map. Without a few tricks in the color scaling, the rest would not differ in color due to this extreme inequality.

The “change map/graph” button can be used to switch to a plot of the trend data for the six strongest economies. The trend also gives an impression of the inequality which the color scaling problem causes.

# Economic Voting

## Row 1

**Economic voting in the Merkel era**

Here are a few multivariate logistic regression models from my final thesis visualized, which show the effects of economic voting on the CDU/CSU as chancellor party during Angela Merkel's chancellorship. The Avarage Marginal Effects (AME) are shown in percent. An example: An AME of 30% means that the probability of voting for the CDU/CSU increases by 30% on average if the variable increases by one unit (please note that the dummy variables can only take the values 0 or 1). Below the plots, the variables are explained.

The result is that economic voting only had an impact in the crisis years 2009 and 2021. However, the situation in 2021 is not so valid, because the confidence interval is close to the null hypothesis. null hypothesis in this case means the absence of an effect; Confidence intervals provide information about the range within which the true effect at the population level lies, given the data and the chosen level of confidence (here 95%). Nevertheless, the models make very good predictions, as they contain a very strong predictor in the form of party identif

The data comes from the following data sets:

GLES, 2019a: Post-election Cross Section (GLES 2009). ZA5301, Köln: GESIS.

GLES, 2019b: Post-election Cross Section (GLES 2013). ZA5701, Köln: GESIS.

GLES, 2019c: Post-election Cross Section (GLES 2017). ZA6801, Köln: GESIS.

GLES, 2023: Post-election Cross Section (GLES 2021). ZA7701, Köln: GESIS

**Explenation of the variables**

| Variable | Explenation |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Dependent variable** |  |
| CDU/CSU | The dummy variable takes the value 1 if the respondents stated that they had voted for the CDU or CSU in the last election. If a different party or non-voters are indicated, the variable takes the value 0. |
| **Predictors** |  |
| Micro increase | Dummy variable assumes the value 1 if the respondent states that their personal economic situation has improved in the last one to two years. Reference 0 if the situation has not changed. |
| Micro decrease | Dummy variable assumes the value 1 if the respondent states that their personal economic situation has deteriorated in the last one to two years. Reference 0 if the situation has not changed. |
| Macro increase | Dummy variable assumes the value 1 if the respondent assumes that the general economy has increased in the last one to two years. Reference 0 if the situation has not changed. |
| Macro decrease | Dummy variable assumes the value 1 if the respondent assumes that the general economy situation has decreased in the last one to two years. Reference 0 if the situation has not changed. |
| Gender | Dummy variable that has the value 1 if the respondent is male. Otherwise, the value is 0. The diverse category only exists in the GLES 2021, but there are no people in this category. |
| Age | Age measured in years |
| East | Dummy variable that has the value 1 if the respondent lives in east Germany. Otherwise the value is 0. |
| Education Realschule | Respondents with an intermediate school certificate have a score of 1. |
| Education Fachabitur |  Respondents with a vocational diploma certificate have a score of 1. |
| Education Abitur | Respondents with a general qualification for university entrance have a score of 1. |
| Income | Net equivalent income. Household income was weighted according to the new OECD scale. As the household income in the data sets, with the exception of GLES2009, was only available in categorical form, the income categories were transformed into a metric scale beforehand. The recommendations published by GESIS, which are available at https://www.gesis.org/missy/files/documents/MZ/Auswertungsbeispiel_BerechnungDes%C3%84quivalenzeinkommens.pdf, were followed. |
| Party Identification | Dummy variable that takes on the value 1 if the respondent can identify with the CDU and/or CSU. If this is not the case, the value is 0. |
